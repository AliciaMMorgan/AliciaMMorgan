### **PMP‐Certified Innovation Leader | Aerospace & Industrial Engineer | AI‐Fluent PM** | **Bridging Tradition + Tech**

Building **agentic, cross‑industry project management workflows** that close the execution gap between knowing what to do and delivering results.

## What Problem I Solve 🎯

Organizations have AI strategies and playbooks—but execution fails: pilots stall, teams misalign, executives doubt ROI.  
**I close the execution gap** by bridging **knowledge → implementation → trust**: turning frameworks into agentic workflows, de-risking delivery with governance, and proving value through shipped outcomes.  
Leaders hire me to operationalize innovation reliably, transforming slideware into measurable enterprise impact.

## 3 core anchors of my work

- **Cross‑Industry PM Playbook**  
  Practical playbook for leading technology and innovation across aerospace, government, nonprofit, education, and enterprise environments.  
  → [cross-industry-pm-playbook-ai-transformation](https://github.com/AliciaMMorgan/cross-industry-pm-playbook-ai-transformation)

- **Innovation‑In‑Action**  
  Agents, PM risk assessors, and prompt libraries that operationalize governance, risk, compliance and value realization for AI and analytics initiatives.  
  → [Innovation-In-Action](https://github.com/AliciaMMorgan/Innovation-In-Action)

- **Speaking‑Resources**  
  Talks, articles, and key takeaways (TEDx, PMI, EWTG, ProjectBites) showing how these frameworks and agents are used in practice.

## What I built in 2025 ⚙️🤝🤖

From June to December 2025, I created a **five-repository ecosystem** that moves from knowledge to implementation to trust.

- **Cross‑Industry PM Playbook** – knowledge foundation (patterns, frameworks, and lessons across sectors).  
- **Innovation‑In‑Action** – executable agents, PM Risk Assessor prompts, and governance workflows.  
- **Speaking‑Resources**, plus the **Operational‑Excellence‑Toolkit** and forked **agents** repo – social proof, team‑ready tools, and production‑grade multi‑agent patterns that inform Q1 2026 deployments.

## 🎯 Featured: 9-Step Career Framework

**From Traditional PM to AI-Fluent Leader** (June–December 2025)

### [📊 View the Complete Visual Journey →](https://github.com/AliciaMMorgan/Innovation-In-Action/blob/main/artifacts/carousel%3A9-steps-traditional-pm-to-ai-fluent-leader.pdf)

This carousel documents the 6-month transformation from traditional PM to building AI agents:

| Phase          | Focus                                      | Key Outcome                                      |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Foundation     | Aerospace + Industrial Engineering         | Structure that enables governance & scale        |
| Evolution      | Cross-sector fluency (aerospace → education → nonprofit) | Pattern recognition across industries            |
| Transformation | AI ecosystem building                      | Working agents, PM Risk Assessor, frameworks     |


**Why this framework matters:**  
The same principles that guided my pivot—process mapping, cross-sector patterns, building in public—can help you navigate yours.

## Currently 

- 🔭 **Currently working on**  
  - PM Risk Assessor and governance agents in **[Innovation‑In‑Action Repo](https://github.com/AliciaMMorgan/Innovation-In-Action)**, moving from tested prompts to Q1 2026 agent deployments across healthcare, aerospace, education, and heavily regulated environments. 
  - Expanding the **Operational‑Excellence‑
Toolkit** with team‑ready canvases and checklists that pair with these agents so organizations can adopt AI without losing control of risk or value delivery.

- 🌱 **Currently learning**  
  - Advanced multi‑agent orchestration patterns from the forked **agents** repo (91 agents, 47 skills, 15 orchestrators) to inform production‑ready workflows that PMs can actually govern. 
  - Best practices for responsible AI adoption using NIST AI RMF and enterprise project management frameworks to keep humans in the loop while scaling automation.

- 💬 **Ask me about**  
  - Closing the execution gap between strategy decks and shipped outcomes using AI‑fluent project management, cross‑industry playbooks, and agentic workflows.
