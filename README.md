## 3 core anchors of my work

- **Cross‑Industry PM Playbook**  
  Practical playbook for leading technology and innovation across aerospace, government, nonprofit, education, and enterprise environments.  
  → [cross-industry-pm-playbook-ai-transformation](https://github.com/AliciaMMorgan/cross-industry-pm-playbook-ai-transformation)

- **Innovation‑In‑Action**  
  Agents, PM risk assessors, and prompt libraries that operationalize governance, risk, and value realization for AI and analytics initiatives.  
  → [Innovation-In-Action](https://github.com/AliciaMMorgan/Innovation-In-Action)

- **Speaking‑Resources**  
  Talks, articles, and key takeaways (TEDx, PMI, EWTG, ProjectBites) showing how these frameworks and agents are used in practice.

## What I built in 2025 ⚙️🤝🤖

From June–December 2025, I created a **five‑repository ecosystem** that moves from knowledge → implementation → trust.

- **Cross‑Industry PM Playbook** – knowledge foundation (patterns, frameworks, and lessons across sectors).  
- **Innovation‑In‑Action** – executable agents, PM Risk Assessor prompts, and governance workflows.  
- **Speaking‑Resources**, plus the **Operational‑Excellence‑Toolkit** and forked **agents** repo – social proof, team‑ready tools, and production‑grade multi‑agent patterns that inform Q1 2026 deployments.

## Currently 🚀

- 🔭 **Currently working on**  
  - PM Risk Assessor and governance agents in **Innovation‑In‑Action**, moving from tested prompts to Q1 2026 agent deployments across healthcare, aerospace, education, and heavily regulated environments. 
  - Expanding the **Operational‑Excellence‑Toolkit** with team‑ready canvases and checklists that pair with these agents so organizations can adopt AI without losing control of risk or value delivery.

- 🌱 **Currently learning**  
  - Advanced multi‑agent orchestration patterns from the forked **agents** repo (91 agents, 47 skills, 15 orchestrators) to inform production‑ready workflows that PMs can actually govern. 
  - Best practices for responsible AI adoption using NIST AI RMF and enterprise project management frameworks to keep humans in the loop while scaling automation.

- 💬 **Ask me about**  
  - Closing the execution gap between strategy decks and shipped outcomes using AI‑fluent project management, cross‑industry playbooks, and agentic workflows.
