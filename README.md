**Dallas Business Journal Women in Technology Awards Advocate Honoree (2019)**  
Recognized as VP Education at Frontiers of Flight Museum for STEM innovation reaching 45K+ students annually—early tech advocacy bridging to AI governance today.

### **PMP‐Certified Innovation Leader | Aerospace & Industrial Engineer | AI‐Fluent PM** | **Bridging Tradition + Tech**

Building **agentic, cross‑industry project management workflows** that close the execution gap between knowing what to do and delivering results.

## What Problem I Solve 🎯

Organizations have AI strategies and playbooks—but execution fails: pilots stall, teams misalign, executives doubt ROI.  
**I close the execution gap** by bridging **knowledge → implementation → trust**: turning frameworks into agentic workflows, de-risking delivery with governance, and proving value through shipped outcomes.  
Leaders hire me to operationalize innovation reliably, transforming slideware into measurable enterprise impact.

## 3 core anchors of my work

- **Cross‑Industry PM Playbook**  
  Practical playbook for leading technology and innovation across aerospace, government, nonprofit, education, and enterprise environments.  
  → [cross-industry-pm-playbook-ai-transformation](https://github.com/AliciaMMorgan/cross-industry-pm-playbook-ai-transformation)

- **Innovation‑In‑Action**  
  Agents, PM risk assessors, and prompt libraries that operationalize governance, risk, compliance and value realization for AI and analytics initiatives.  
  → [Innovation-In-Action](https://github.com/AliciaMMorgan/Innovation-In-Action)

- **Speaking‑Resources**  
  Talks, articles, and key takeaways (TEDx, PMI, EWTG, ProjectBites) showing how these frameworks and agents are used in practice.

## What I built in 2025 ⚙️🤝🤖

From June to December 2025, I created a **five-repository ecosystem** that moves from knowledge to implementation to trust.

- **Cross‑Industry PM Playbook** – knowledge foundation (patterns, frameworks, and lessons across sectors).  
- **Innovation‑In‑Action** – executable agents, PM Risk Assessor prompts, and governance workflows.  
- **Speaking‑Resources**, plus the **Operational‑Excellence‑Toolkit** and forked **agents** repo – social proof, team‑ready tools, and production‑grade multi‑agent patterns that inform Q1 2026 deployments.

## 🎯 Featured: 9-Step Career Framework

**From Traditional PM to AI-Fluent Leader** (June–December 2025)

### [📊 View the Complete Visual Journey →](https://github.com/AliciaMMorgan/Innovation-In-Action/blob/main/artifacts/carousel%3A9-steps-traditional-pm-to-ai-fluent-leader.pdf)

This carousel documents the 6-month transformation from traditional PM to building AI agents:

| Phase          | Focus                                      | Key Outcome                                      |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Foundation     | Aerospace + Industrial Engineering         | Structure that enables governance & scale        |
| Evolution      | Cross-sector fluency (aerospace → education → nonprofit) | Pattern recognition across industries            |
| Transformation | AI ecosystem building                      | Working agents, PM Risk Assessor, frameworks     |


**Why this framework matters:**  
The same principles that guided my pivot—process mapping, cross-sector patterns, building in public—can help you navigate yours.

## Currently 🚀

* 🔭 **Currently working on**

  + Q1 2026 prototype complete — Cross-Industry AI Agent built in **Microsoft Azure AI Foundry**, validated through scenario-based acceptance tests across healthcare, aerospace, and education PM environments. Moving toward Version 2 expansion with an Evidence Ladder linking AI actions to executive decision thresholds.
  + Active **SME AI Coach** engagement guiding non-technical teams through responsible AI adoption using Human-in-the-Loop frameworks, staged fluency progressions, and cross-industry pattern recognition.

* 🌱 **Currently learning**

  + Structured AI initiative categorization using PMI's **CPMAI framework** (IIL-trained) — distinguishing project-level experiments from portfolio-level implementations before recommending deployment paths.
  + Enterprise agent governance patterns: when Copilot Studio is sufficient versus when Azure AI Foundry is required for full lifecycle evaluation, safety testing, and scalable architecture.

* 💬 **Ask me about**

  + Why PMs are not struggling with AI tools — they are struggling with positioning AI inside organizational reality. Stage confusion, business value translation gaps, and governance timing misalignment are the real blockers. That is what the agent was built to solve.
